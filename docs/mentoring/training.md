- Topics to cover

## Mentor Training Event(s)
Welcome to the RCOS mentor team! At the beginning of each semester, we hold mentor training sessions to help get our new mentors started.

Our training sessions for Fall 2018 will occur on the following dates and times in [location TBD]:
<!-- 
Ideally, we should have at least one timeslot on or after August 27th since that is the earliest time that upperclassmen residence halls/on campus apartments open. 
However, we should ideally host our training session before our first large group or before our second large group (Tuesday) at the very latest. 
-->
  - TBD 

If you are unable to physically attend the session(s), Hangouts links will be provided.

## Topics Covered in Mentor Training
Below is a rough outline of what will be covered in the training sessions.

### Estimated Time Commitments
Bare minimum:
  - **Mentor training**: mandatory for all first-time mentors, optional for returning mentors (returning mentors may help facilitate training and/or answer any questions)
  - **Small group**: ~1-2 hours weekly (usually on Tuesdays)
  - **Large group**: ~1-2 hours weekly
  - **Mentor meetings**: biweekly, typically no longer than 30 mins-1 hour

You may also be expected to help with casual coding sessions, bonus sessions, and/or code jams. 

### First Two Weeks
The first two weeks agenda can be found [here](coordinating/agenda). 

As a mentor, you are expected to help out with proposal review and/or project speed dating. If you have a course conflict on Tuesdays at 4pm (e.g. ECSE seminar), please let the coordinators know so that:
  - your absence during these meetings can be marked as excused
  - you can be placed in an alternate small group (typically held at 6pm on Tuesday)

### Using Observatory as a Mentor
  - Verification
  - Setting up a small group
  - Generating small group attendance codes

### Running Small Group
A brief overview of small group meetings for RCOS members can be found [here](events/small_group_meetings). Mentor training will additionally cover:
  - Running standup
  - Reviewing presentations <!-- really emphasize presentation review this semester --> 

### Helping in Large Group
  - Managing noise levels/talking
  - Verifying members

### Handling Code of Conduct Violations
Please familiarize yourselves with our [Code of Conduct](resources/CODE_OF_CONDUCT) and [Bylaws](resources/bylaws). As a mentor, you are not only expected to follow these, but to enforce them where appropriate. 

Any violations warranting more than a verbal/Slack warning (e.g. repeated offenses, harassment) should be reported to coordinators/faculty advisors, who will then determine the appropriate action(s) necessary.
