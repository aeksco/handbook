# Grading Rubric

TODO - this document must be refactored to include the other optional.

Although RCOS is a team sport, grading is done on the individual member. Make sure you meet the requirements, including the requirements on the project itself such as the README, License and other forms of documentation.

**If you find this rubric to be incompatible with your project, or you believe that it will significantly hinder or not accurately represent your progress, please let a coordinator or faculty member know as adjustments and exceptions can be made.**

## Addendum - Code of Conduct:
We want all of you at RCOS to learn in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. The way you conduct yourself at RCOS may have a long-lasting impact on the community, whether that be positive or negative.

Students who go above and beyond to model and encourage positive behaviors outlined in our community Code of Conduct may receive a bonus added to the [Flex](grading/flex.md) portion of their grade and/or additional consideration for leadership positions within RCOS (e.g. task force teams, mentor, coordinator).  

On the other hand, students may be penalized, depending on the severity of the offense, for violating the Code of Conduct. These penalties are given at faculty discretion and may range from a small attendance penalty to an F in the course.
