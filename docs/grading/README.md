# Grading Requirements

RCOS is largely a self-guided class, which can make grading difficult. Instructors assign appropriate grades using utilities such as [Observatory](https://rcos.io/) to track open source contributions and community involvement.

The following grading criteria are designed to help you succeed as an RCOS student and in the open source community. Generally speaking, if you're contributing to the community and/or making valuable open-source contributions you'll receive a high grade in RCOS.

## Project Management

### Proposal

Each project must start with a proposal which will serve as a plan and contract. Your proposal should describe a set of well defined milestones with planned dates of completion. Details on milestone requirements are described in the [Milestones and Issues](#Milestones-and-Issues) section.

The proposal and milestones must be approved by a mentor at the start of the semester. However, it is important to remember that the proposal is a living document. Plans often change, and that is OK.

### Milestones and Issues

You must use GitHub Milestones and Issues to define and track progress of your project.

Milestones are specific points along the project timeline. Milestones are designed to signal the start and end of phases of the project. Milestones are generally over-arching goals and should define the project's direction.

Issues are small increments of your project. They should have clear acceptance criteria, and should contain enough background information that someone completely new to the project could easily understand the task. Each issue should belong to a milestone. Common issue topics include but aren't limited to:
- New features
- Designs
- Research goals
- Architecture changes
- Project management tasks
- Business development
- Documentation
- Community outreach
- Testing

Project members must keep their milestones and issues up to date as the project progresses. This includes updating milestones and issues as the project evolves. Project members should comment on issues to ask questions, report progress, and have discussions regarding the issue.

Each team member should contribute to at least 3 milestones, and multiple team members can of course collaborate on any given milestone. These are suggested values and many groups may find different numbers to be appropriate.

Progress for each milestone must be thoroughly documented in one or more blog posts. See [Blog Posts](#blog-posts) for more information. If a milestone is not a functional change, there should be a greater focus on documentation to appropriately convey the work that was done.

If you are not sure how to best divide up your project into milestones and issues, please ask a mentor for assistance.

## Documentation

Projects should be well documented. Documentation can take many forms. A README and an [OSI approved license](https://choosealicense.com/) are mandatory. The README should include a summary of the project, instructions for contributing, and any other information needed to develop for and use the project.

Additional documentation (other than a README and blog posts) is required. Examples of additional documentation include but are not limited to:
- Business plans & reports
- UML diagrams
- API documents
- User manuals
- FAQs
- Setup guides
- Troubleshooting information

The use of a wiki is strongly encouraged. Creating a static project site can help you organize your various forms of documentation and provide excellent exposure for your project.

If you are unsure how to properly document your project, please consult your mentor for advice early on.

### Blog Posts

Blog posts should be informative, and are often status updates about your project. They can also be more general or written in the form of a guide or tutorial. Blog posts that may help another developer solve a problem that you have solved are extremely valuable to the open source community. In general you should write blog posts that you would want to read and that you would find useful!

Blog posts are also a good way to explain the high level goals of a project, to indicate that a project is struggling (someone in RCOS might be able to help!) or just to document tasks that don't fall easily into other categories.

The minimum requirement for blog posts is one per milestone plus one at the start and end of the semester, but you are strongly encouraged to do more. Blog early and blog often!

## Presentations and Community Involvement

Each project group is required to give one large group presentation. Presentations should be well prepared and rehearsed in the presence of a mentor for feedback. See [RCOS presentations](http://rcos.github.io/intro/presentations#/) for more details.

### Tech Talks & Bonus Sessions

In addition to the large group project presentation, each member is required to either give one large group tech talk, host a bonus session, or alternatively attend a bonus session. A bonus session is simply any event hosted outside of the normal RCOS hours. Upperclassmen and more senior members are encouraged to give tech talks for the benefit of the RCOS community. All members are encouraged to attend bonus sessions. A bonus session attended in lieu of hosting a bonus session or giving a tech talk cannot also count as an attendence makeup.

## External Contributions

Contribute to something outside of RCOS or help out another group with an issue! External contributions are encouraged as it allows RCOS to give back to the larger open source community. The project you're contributing to should be used by a significant number of people outside of RPI.

Within RCOS, we also want to generate a community of helping other projects and making your project more friendly to outside contributors. If you're doing your external contributions to another RCOS project, it must be a project that you have not previouly worked on and you must communicate with the project through GitHub issues, PRs, and code reviews.

External contributions are strongly encouraged but are not required. With the approval of a mentor, a significant external contribution can take the place of a ~~single~~ [milestone requirement](#milestones).
